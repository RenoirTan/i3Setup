# i3Setup

Made my own i3 Setup.

# Packages

 - i3, the whole lot of it, including i3-gaps if the i3 package in your distribution isn't compiled with i3-gaps in it.
 - flameshot for screenshots
 - picom for window transparency effects
 - polybar for top bar
 - ranger for file exploring
 - rofi, light spotlight on mac
 - pywal, some python package for generating colour schemes

# Instructions

Install the programs listed under [Packages](#packages).

Copy the files and directories under `./user` to `$HOME`.

Restart i3. Hopefully it works.
